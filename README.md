# Real Time Bus Tracker for Kauai Hawaii Bus Stops

## Description

In this project, I demonstrate a web application using the [MapBox API](https://www.mapbox.com) to create and display a map of Kauai, Hawaii. By utilizing JavaScript and HTML I've create a Map Marker to show bus stops between Lihue and Hanalai on Kauai.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

To run this program, click the button _"Click Here"_ at the top right of the browser. The map marker will begin to move through the bus stops starting in Lihue and moving up the coast to Hanalei. The user can zoom in and out as needed.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements include adding other bus routes to other areas of the island. Also adding code to trace the route of each bus route in different colors.
